PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system and
the ability to work in BTEQ mode.

=====================================

There are no special dependencies for BTEQ mode to work.
You need to perform the usual PostgreSQL installation process.
See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install.
The following actions must be performed in order to work in the BTEQ mode.

    - Interactive mode:
      ./src/bin/psql/psql -m 1 or --mode 1
    - Batch mode:
      ./src/bin/psql/psql -m 1 or --mode 1 < cmd_filename

The following files have been modified to work in BTEQ mode.

    src/tools/pgindent/typedefs.list
    src/tools/msvc/Mkvcbuild.pm
    src/tools/msvc/clean.bat
    src/fe_utils/Makefile
    src/bin/psql/startup.c
    src/bin/psql/settings.h
    src/bin/psql/nls.mk
    src/bin/psql/Makefile
    src/bin/psql/common.h
    src/bin/psql/common.c
    src/bin/psql/.gitignore

The following files were added to work in the BTEQ mode.

    src/bin/psql/bteqscandot.h
    src/bin/psql/bteqscandot.l
    src/bin/psql/commandbteq.c
    src/bin/psql/commandbteq.h
    src/bin/psql/mainloopbteq.c
    src/bin/psql/mainloopbteq.h
    src/fe_utils/bteqscan.l
    src/include/fe_utils/bteqscan.h
    src/fe_utils/printbteq.c

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including

and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
